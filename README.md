Week 1
I used a vertical timeline tutorial(https://codyhouse.co/gem/vertical-timeline/). It was a lot of code to take it, so I tried to take it in a little at time, and implement it in my project. I put in the first three entries for the timeline, I didn't worry about the css, I just wanted to make sure the animation worked. I had trouble with the pictures. There too small in the icons, so I think I'm going to have do something different with them. Next week, I'm going to add the rest of the stadiums, and add a function that makes it easier to find the stadium the user wants.


week 2
This week I added the rest of teams to the timelines and made sure the animation was working correctly. I added a four drop down menus to make
the timeline easier to use. I separated it by region in the US. I was trying to use slide.toggle to be able to click on the picture and see more
information about the stadium. I want to work on that more next week. The thing I struggled with the most was linking the dropdown
menu to the spot on the page, but I was able to figure that out today with this tutorial https://codepen.io/philhoyt/pen/ujHzd. I'm pleased with how the pictures and the timeline info matches up with
the picture on the left and the info on the right.
Evaluate what you accomplished in the week.

Week 3
This week I added all the css to make my page looked good. I decided to put the pictures in the div with the information so everything would work the same on different sizes. I added a slide.toggle, so users can click on the photo and see more information. I was having trouble getting it to work, but adding the call function made it work. I wasn't able to figure out the to alternate the stadiums on either side of the timeline. I'm going to keep working on that this weekend.

Final Summary
I’m really proud of what I was able to accomplish with this project. It came out looking like what I pictured at the beginning. I definitely ran into some problems, but I was able to overcome them. One the hardest things was trying to decide what to do with the pictures. At first I was going to leave them on the timeline line, but I realized this week it would look better to use an icon and then move the pictures below the information. I wasn’t able to figure out how to alternate the stadiums, but I’m still really pleased with how it looks. I think it’s a good site with the users in mind.
